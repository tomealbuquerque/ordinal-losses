# A Non-Parametric Loss for Ordinal Classification of Cervical Cancer Risk

by Tom√© Albuquerque, Ricardo Cruz, Jaime S. Cardoso

## Usage

  1. Run preprocess.py to generate the folds.
  2. Run train.py to train the models you want.
  3. Run evaluate.py to generate results table.

## Code organization

  * **data/:** original and pre-processed data
  * **train.py:** train the different models with the different ordinal losses
    and outputs probabilities.
  * **evaluate.py:** generate latex tables with results using the output
    probabilities.
